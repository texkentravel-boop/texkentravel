  <h2>Travel Rooted in Experience</h2>

  <p>
    Travel has been a defining part of my life for as long as I can remember.
    From early adventures close to home to exploring destinations across the world,
    travel has shaped how I connect with people, cultures, and places.
  </p>

  <p>
    A pivotal moment in my journey came while traveling through Kenya.
    Experiencing the country’s landscapes, wildlife, and—most importantly—
    the strength and warmth of the local communities left a lasting impression.
    Safaris were more than game drives; they were moments of perspective,
    connection, and respect for the natural world.
  </p>

  <p>
    That experience inspired the foundation of TexKen Travel.
    My work as a travel advisor extends far beyond Africa. I have traveled extensively throughout Europe,
    beginning with my first international experience at eighteen, and have since
    continued exploring destinations around the globe.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, I use that firsthand knowledge to help clients plan thoughtful,
    well-supported journeys—whether that means a once-in-a-lifetime safari,
    a cruise, a European getaway, a theme park vacation, or a meaningful
    custom itinerary anywhere in the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to planning travel, I also mentor those who feel called to turn
    their love of travel into a profession. If you’re interested in learning
    how to become a travel advisor and build a business rooted in authenticity,
    flexibility, and global connection, I’m happy to share more.
  </p>
