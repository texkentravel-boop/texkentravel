   ## 🦓 Things to Know Before Going on a Kenya Safari

A Kenya safari is an unforgettable experience, but it’s different from a traditional vacation. Here are a few important things to know as you plan your trip.

### 🌅 Early Mornings Are Part of the Experience
Wildlife is most active early in the morning and late afternoon. Expect early wake-ups and cooler temperatures — the best time for game viewing.

### 🐘 Wildlife Sightings Are Never Guaranteed
Animals roam freely in the wild. Every game drive is unique, and sightings vary day to day. The unpredictability is what makes safari so special.

### 🗺️ Kenya Offers Diverse Safari Regions
Each area provides a different experience:
- **Masai Mara** – Big cats and the Great Migration
- **Amboseli** – Elephants with Mount Kilimanjaro views
- **Samburu** – Remote landscapes and rare species
- **Lake Nakuru / Naivasha** – Rhinos, flamingos, and walking safaris  

Most itineraries combine two or more regions.

### ✈️ Travel Between Camps Takes Time
Distances may look short on a map, but roads can be rough. Many itineraries include small bush flights to maximize time on safari.

### 🎒 Packing Is Simple but Intentional
Neutral colors, comfortable shoes, and light layers are best. Binoculars are highly recommended for wildlife viewing.

### 🦒 The Great Migration Is Seasonal
The Great Migration is typically seen in Kenya between **July and October** in the Masai Mara, though timing can vary slightly each year.

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Family-Friendly With the Right Plan
Safaris can be a great experience for families when planned correctly. Some camps have age limits, and private guides are ideal for traveling with children.

### 🏝️ Safari Pairs Perfectly With the Beach
Many travelers combine safari with time on the coast, such as:
- Diani Beach
- Watamu
- Zanzibar

### 🛡️ Travel Insurance Is Essential
Due to remote locations and small aircraft travel, comprehensive travel insurance — including medical evacuation — is strongly recommended.
